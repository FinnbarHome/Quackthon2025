# Requirements:

## Functionality: 
The ATM interface must allow users to perform typical banking functions such as:
- Withdrawing money
- Deposit money
- Check account balance
- Change PIN

## Security: 
- The ATM must implement secure user authentication (PIN entry) and provide an option to log out.

## Usability: 
- The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear instructions for users.

### Visual Design:
    - A simple screen displaying prompts and user options.
    - Buttons for interaction, such as withdraw, deposit, balance inquiry, etc.
    - Error messages or confirmation messages when necessary.
    - Integration with Backend: The interface should interact with a backend system to manage the user's balance, authenticate user data, and handle requests (e.g., processing withdrawals, deposits, transfers).
    - Real-Time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to the user for their actions (e.g., transaction success/failure, insufficient funds).

## Deliverables:

### User Interface Design:
        A wireframe or mockup of the ATM interface, showing all possible screens (login, main menu, withdrawal, etc.).
        Visual design assets, such as button layouts and screen elements.
### Codebase for the Interface:
        The C# code that handles the graphical user interface (GUI).
        Implementation of the ATMâ€™s interactive features using dC# (e.g., button clicks, text display, and user input).
### User Manual:
        A document explaining how to interact with the ATM interface, along with screenshots to guide the user through the process.
### Backend Integration Code:
        A module that connects the ATM interface with the backend system to handle transactions.

## Testing:

### Functionality Testing:
        Test all features of the ATM interface (withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, etc.).
        Ensure the system behaves correctly under normal conditions (e.g., withdrawing within the balance limit, depositing valid amounts).
### Security Testing:
        PIN Authentication: Test the PIN entry system to ensure that only valid PINs allow access to the ATM features.
        Test for error handling in cases of incorrect PINs, locked accounts, or unauthorized actions.
### Usability Testing:
        Perform tests with different users to ensure that the interface is clear and intuitive.
        Test how well the interface handles error cases and edge scenarios, such as when the user selects an invalid option.
### Edge Case Testing:
        Test edge cases like insufficient funds, maximum withdrawal limits, and handling of large deposit amounts.
        Ensure the system displays proper error messages in these situations.
### Integration Testing:
        Test the communication between the ATM interface and backend system. Ensure that requests such as balance inquiries and withdrawals are correctly processed by the backend.
### Performance Testing:
        Measure how quickly the ATM interface responds to user inputs and how well it handles concurrent user requests if applicable.
