# Requirements for ATM Interface (Minimum Viable Product):

## Functionality: 
The ATM interface must allow users to perform typical banking functions such as:
- [ ] Withdrawing money
- Deposit money
- Check account balance
- Change PIN

## Security: 
- The ATM must implement secure user authentication (PIN entry) and provide an option to log out.

## Usability: 
- The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear instructions for users.

### Visual Design:
- A simple screen displaying prompts and user options.
- Buttons for interaction, such as withdraw, deposit, balance inquiry, etc.
- Error messages or confirmation messages when necessary.
- Balance will be calculated locally and stored within the C# app.
- Real-Time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to the user for their actions (e.g., transaction success/failure, insufficient funds).

## Deliverables:

### User Interface Design:
- A wireframe or mockup of the ATM interface, showing all possible screens (login, main menu, withdrawal, etc.).
- Visual design assets, such as button layouts and screen elements.
### Codebase for the Interface:
- The C# code that handles the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Implementation of the ATMâ€™s interactive features using C# (e.g., button clicks, text display, and user input).

## Testing:

### Functionality Testing:
- Test all features of the ATM interface (withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, etc.).
- Ensure the system behaves correctly under normal conditions (e.g., withdrawing within the balance limit, depositing valid amounts).
### Security Testing:
- PIN Authentication: Test the PIN entry system to ensure that only valid PINs allow access to the ATM features.
- Test for error handling in cases of incorrect PINs, locked accounts, or unauthorized actions.
### Usability Testing:
- Test how well the interface handles error cases and edge scenarios, such as when the user selects an invalid option.
### Edge Case Testing:
- Test edge cases like insufficient funds, maximum withdrawal limits, and handling of large deposit amounts.
- Ensure the system displays proper error messages in these situations.
